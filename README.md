App I want to build: 
Background: 
There has been a problem bothering me for a long time. I need to be more motivated during the long process of studying, so I am thinking about buiding an app that can motivate me to study with features like reminding me to take a rest during the long process of studying/working. For me, I usually start working and forget about time. Later on, I have eye issues because of long non stop studying. Building this app will be super useful and important to me. 
Features:
People might ask, why not using a clock to remind ourselve? My answer is, this is different than the clock since there will be more than the timing feature. The main feature is to record our studying time in order to motivate, and the side feature is that there will be a reminder to take a break. If we our study time reaches a certain amount, there will be new rewards in the app for us to unlock such as collecting icons/badages.
