## App Brainstorming: **Study Motivator**
**Background**:
There's a persistent issue I've encountered: staying motivated during long study sessions. This app's main aim is to help users like me, who often lose track of time during study sessions, potentially leading to health issues. This app serves as a motivational tool to enhance the studying experience.

**Why Not Just Use A Clock?**: 
The purpose of this app isn't just time-keeping. It goes beyond that. The main feature is to record our studying time in order to motivate, and the side feature is that there will be a reminder to take a break. If we our study time reaches a certain amount, there will be new rewards in the app for us to unlock such as collecting icons/badages. 

**Features**:
- **Main Feature**: Record study time to motivate users.
- **Side Feature**: Reminder to take breaks.
- **Rewards**: As users accumulate study hours, they can unlock rewards like icons and badges.
